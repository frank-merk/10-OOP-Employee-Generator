## Overview

This application uses ES6, Node.js, inquirer, path, jest and fs to genrate a team web page from the command line.

## Installation

To insall, first make sure you have the dependencies (in this case, jest, inquirer, path, and fs):

`npm install`

To run the application from the terminal, you will enter:

`node app.js`

## Strategy

My goal was to follow the structure provided in the ReadME and in the commented template files. I began by writing my classes and testing in Jest. Once those all passed, I got all of my inquire questions written, and had to figure out the best way to control user flow, which involved some nested prompts.

## Challenges

The number of files proved a bit challenging in terms of tracking my modules and staying organized. However, most of the novel code lives in the app.js file, so that makes it a bit easier to track. I also struggled for a while with getting the user flow to work smoothly, and I'm happy with how it turned out.
